# PythonElectron
This project is just a sample to show how the integration between Python and Electron works.


## Requirements
- This project was made using Windows, so you will do changes to work in a different S.O.
- Node installed in your machine.
- The libraries 'python-shell' and 'path' installed (npm install python-shell & npm install path) on the project.


## How to distribute my app?
You need to install 'electron-packager' globally (npm install electron-packager -g) and execute the following command in the project root directory:
'electron-packager . --asa'

The 'asa' argument will cript your files.
